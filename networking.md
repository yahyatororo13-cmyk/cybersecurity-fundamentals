# Networking Fundamentals

This document contains my learning notes about computer networking.
I am currently learning the basics required for cybersecurity and IT security roles.

## What is a Network?
A network is a group of devices (computers, servers, routers) that are connected together to share data and resources.

Examples:
- Home network
- Company network
- Internet

---

## Types of Networks
- LAN (Local Area Network)
- WAN (Wide Area Network)
- WLAN (Wireless LAN)

LAN is used inside homes and companies.
WAN is used to connect networks over long distances (example: the Internet).

## OSI Model
The OSI model has 7 layers:

1. Physical – cables, signals
2. Data Link – MAC addresses, switches
3. Network – IP addresses, routing
4. Transport – TCP / UDP
5. Session
6. Presentation
7. Application – HTTP, FTP, DNS

The OSI model helps understand how data moves inside a network.

## IP Address
An IP address is a unique number assigned to a device in a network.

Examples:
- IPv4: 192.168.1.1
- IPv6: 2001:db8::1

There are:
- Private IP addresses (used inside networks)
- Public IP addresses (used on the Internet)

---

## TCP vs UDP
TCP:
- Connection-oriented
- Reliable
- Slower
- Used for HTTP, HTTPS, FTP

UDP:
- Connectionless
- Faster
- Less reliable
- Used for DNS, streaming, gaming

---

## Ports
Ports are used to identify services on a device.

Examples:
- Port 80 → HTTP
- Port 443 → HTTPS
- Port 22 → SSH
- Port 53 → DNS

---

## What I Learned
- Basic network concepts
- How data travels between devices
- Difference between TCP and UDP
- Importance of ports in cybersecurity

## Next Steps
- Learn subnetting
- Practice with tools like ping and nmap
- Study network security basics
